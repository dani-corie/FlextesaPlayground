# FlextesaPlayground

This is a minimalistic convenience layer to run the Tezos dev chain FlexTesa.

Yes, it's three bash scripts, two of which are entirely trivial. Flextesa is a pretty good product to start with, and TQ's Docker image is quite good.

Still, I want an environment I can pull up literally without thinking, at the push of a button, and this is that.
